# Vehicle-toll
So, this repository is about identifying the type of vehicle on a toll and then predicting  the corresponding rate to it.
However, in this repo i am only considering truck,bus,car and motorbike.

# Requirements
 1.Opencv
 2.Pretrained yolo-coco model(cfg,weights,names).
 3.A sample video.

So, to run this code you first need to download cfg,weights file from this site- https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/  and you can download the names file from the repo.

Now put these three file(cfg,weights,coco.names) in a folder named trivial now upload this folder to jupyter or copy it in your jupyter notebook default directory.
Also put the sample video to your jupyter current directory.
